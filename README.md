# **meetings re-imagined**

## **Aim of the site**

This is a site designed to showcase a (fictional) training and meeting centre. The site will 
be targeted towards corporate bookers and corporate travel agents, and has a definite
business to business aim.

---

## **UX**

Given the target market of B2B, it needs to have a corporate & professional look and feel, but at the 
same time keep up with the market trend of being somewhere that looks like a vibrant,
exciting and interesting place. One that meeting delegates would enjoy spending a day at, and one that bookers
feel will meet the needs of those they are booking for. Also, the vast majority of use will
be via desktops but of course the tablet and mobile layouts need to work.

Potential bookers need to be able to see everything that is included (what 
they get for their money), and need to be able to 
make a decision as to whether this is a suitable venue for their meeting on one visit
to the site. 

There needs to be lots of "Enquiry" opportunities present, and a way of completing a form to 
express interest and establish contact.

## **Client Stories**

    "As a corporate administrator looking to book a venue for my manager, I need the site
    to give me everything I need to make a decision without having to return to it, or ask questions"

    "As a corporate travel agent I want to be assured that this solution for my 
    client is a professional, and I want to rest in the knowledge that the venue will be able to deliver"

    "As a manager, I want this venue to showcase the offer they have, and when I look at it 
    - to be re-assured that this venue will provide a productive space where my team will 
    be innovative and creative"

## **Site features**

### **Main picture**
This needs to be big and bold, and really showcase a positive aspect of the product,
it should also have another **ENQUIRE** opportunity.

### **Overview section**

This should provide an overview of what is offered and provided, transport convenience,
the main features of what is included, as well as where this venue differs from others.

### **Carousel**

This provides a further visual of what the venue looks like, and demonstrate the overall
look and feel of the venue. Should also have an opportunity to **ENQUIRE**

### **Space description**

This provides detail about what specific rooms there are and an overview of them. Also 
needs a contact number. Also a link to a **CATERING** PDF file opening in a different
window.

### **Capacity chart**

This shows how many people the individual rooms can accommodate dependent on
what style of setup is required.

### **Room pictures**

Visual pictures of what individual rooms look like.

### **Contact**

A contact form with Name, Email, Phone, Number attending, 
and "What do you want to achieve" fields. It also needs a phone contact number.

## Future goals

It would be great in the future for users to be able to make actual bookings through the
site and also to incorporate a dynamic pricing model.

For a live site taking bookings a "Chat with us" opportunity would be desired.
